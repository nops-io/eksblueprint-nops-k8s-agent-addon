Reporting Potential Security Issues
1

If you come across any vulnerability or bug in this project, please report it 
to us at support@nops.io and not via GitHub issue.


We will make sure that our security team work with you to verify the 
vulnerability, build a patch, validate the fix, and finally issue a public 
report.

When reporting issues, please provide the following information:

* Description of affected components with the detail to reproduce the 
issue 

* Summary of security vulnerability together with its impact

We request that you contact us via the email address mentioned above 
and give the project contributors a chance to resolve the vulnerability and
issue a new release prior to any public exposure; this will help them 
protect the project's users, and will also give them a chance to upgrade 
and/or update the applications or any of its affected components.

If we verify a reported security vulnerability, our policy is to:

* Patch the current release branch, as well as the immediate prior 
minor release branch.

* Issuing new security fix releases for each patched release branch.

A security advisory will also be released on the project website detailing 
the vulnerability, as well as recommendations for end-users to protect 
themselves. All security advisories will be listed on the project wiki.
